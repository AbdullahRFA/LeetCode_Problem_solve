"""
Given a string array words, return an array of all characters that show up in all strings within the words (including duplicates). You may return the answer in any order.



Example 1:

Input: words = ["bella","label","roller"]
Output: ["e","l","l"]
Example 2:

Input: words = ["cool","lock","cook"]
Output: ["c","o"]

âœ… Solution Technique: Character Frequency Intersection

ðŸ’¡ Idea:
	1.	Count the frequency of each character in the first word using Counter.
	2.	For each remaining word, update the frequency count by intersecting it with the current counter using the & operator.
	3.	The final counter contains only the characters that appear in all words, with the correct number of duplicates.
	4.	Expand the counter into a list of characters.

Metric
Complexity
Time
O(n * k), where n = number of words, k = average word length
Space
O(1) since only lowercase letters are used (aÃ¢â‚¬â€œz)
