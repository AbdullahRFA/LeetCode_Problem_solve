"""
Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without duplicate characters.



Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
Example 2:

Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Example 3:

Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

âœ… Step-by-step Logic:
	1.	Initialize:
	â€¢	left = 0: start of the window
	â€¢	char_set = set(): to store unique characters in the current window
	â€¢	max_len = 0: to store the maximum length found so far
	2.	Loop through each character (right):
	â€¢	If the character is already in the set, it means thereâ€™s a duplicate.
	â€¢	So, shrink the window from the left by removing characters until the duplicate is removed.
	â€¢	Add the current character to the set.
	â€¢	Update the maximum length as right - left + 1.

ðŸš€ Time & Space Complexity:
	â€¢	Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string â€” each character is processed at most twice.
	â€¢	Space Complexity: O(k), where k is the number of unique characters in the string.
