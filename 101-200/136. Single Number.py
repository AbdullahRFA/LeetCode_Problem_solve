"""
Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,2,1]

Output: 1

Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]

Output: 4

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1]

Output: 1

âœ… Technique: Bitwise XOR

ðŸ”§ XOR Properties:
	1.	a ^ a = 0 â†’ any number XORed with itself is zero.
	2.	a ^ 0 = a â†’ any number XORed with 0 stays unchanged.
	3.	XOR is commutative and associative:
	â€¢	So, the order doesnâ€™t matter.
	
	â€¢	Initially, res = 0
	â€¢	For each number in the list:
	â€¢	It XORs the number with res.
	â€¢	Duplicate numbers cancel each other (since a ^ a = 0)
	â€¢	The number that appears once remains at the end.
	
	ðŸ“Œ Use This Technique When:
	â€¢	Every number appears twice, except one that appears once.

âœ… Technique Summary:
	â€¢	This approach uses a hash map (dictionary) to count frequencies.
	â€¢	Itâ€™s simple and works well even if more than one number has different frequencies.
