"""
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.



Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
Example 2:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.


ðŸ’¡ Step-by-Step Thinking

We want to find the lowest price to buy and the highest profit we can get afterward by selling.

â¸»

ðŸ§  Intuition:

Loop through the list:
	â€¢	Keep track of the minimum price so far (best day to buy).
	â€¢	On each day, calculate the profit if you sold today: today's price - min_price_so_far.
	â€¢	Track the maximum profit weâ€™ve seen so far.
